# Deep_Learning
Build a Deep learning model from scratch and compare it with that of using pre-trained models that can accurately distinguish between fake and real images using the provided images for training. The images provided belong to two classes for images that were actually clicked using cameras vs images that were artificially created using Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs).
